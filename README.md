# NBA Serverless Data Pipeline (Terraform + AWS + Grafana)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
A 100% serverless data engineering project built on AWS using Terraform. It ingests data from the **Balldontlie NBA API**, processes and transforms it using AWS Glue, analyzes it via Athena, and visualizes key insights in Grafana.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone this GitHub repo and navigate to the directory.

### 2. Set up your environment
Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and configure variables such as AWS region, bucket name, etc.

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure
Deploy all infrastructure components, including Lambda, Kinesis, S3, Glue, and Athena, using Terraform.

### 4. Test the Lambda
Invoke the Lambda function manually or wait for the scheduled run to ingest NBA game data.

### 5. Process Data with Glue
Run the Glue job to transform and normalize the raw NBA data and store it in the processed S3 path.

### 6. Query with Athena
Use Athena queries to explore the transformed data and prepare inputs for dashboards.

### 7. Visualize in Grafana
Connect Grafana to Athena and import the provided dashboard template to display insights.

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack
- AWS Lambda, EventBridge, S3, Kinesis Firehose
- AWS Glue (PySpark), Glue Crawlers, Glue Data Catalog
- AWS Athena
- Grafana
- Terraform (IaC)
- Balldontlie NBA API (https://www.balldontlie.io/)

---

## ðŸ’¬ Notes
- Terraform automates provisioning of all necessary AWS resources.
- Balldontlie API is used for free, public access to NBA stats and player data.
- Glue jobs can be enhanced for partitioning and incremental loads.
- Retry logic should be implemented in Lambda to handle API rate limits gracefully.
